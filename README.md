# Microbialites Database System

## ℹ️ Overview
This project was developed in collaboration with the **Geology Department** at the University of St. Thomas. The goal was to replace an existing Microsoft Access database with a more robust and scalable **SQL-based database system** supported by a **Python graphical user interface**.

The system allows users to view, add, update, and delete records based on permission levels, improving data integrity, usability, and long-term maintainability.
